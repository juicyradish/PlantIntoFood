  <p><br>
    We are a group of passionate undergraduate students who want to do our best to help people in our society. 
     We draw our inspiration from an app called "Ant Forest", which people can earn points through various methods,
    whenever they take a step to reduce their emissions, and they can use their points to plant trees.</p>

<button class="collapsible">About Our Project</button>
<div class="content">
  <p><br>
    Our project has two main goals: to help homeless people in our society and to promote a healthier lifestyle.
     There are various ways you can earn "supports points"; please go to the "Points-System" section to see the details. 
     You can use the points to redeem items, such as food, daily supplies, and we"ll donate that food to people in need!
     After you've donated your food, you will receive corresponding "achievement points". You can use those points to change for small gifts!
     <br>
     Also, you will be able to see the plant photos you've uploaded, and you can make your unique photo collections for your cute baby plants!
