  <p><br>
    We are a group of passionate undergraduate students who want to do our best to help people in our society. 
     We draws our inspiration from an app called "Ant Forest", in which people can earn points though various methods,
    whenever they take a step to reduce their emissions, and the points can be used to plant trees.</p>

<button class="collapsible">About Our Project</button>
<div class="content">
  <p><br>
    Our project is aiming for helping homeless people in our society, as well as promoting a healthier lifestyle.
     There are various ways you can earn "supports points". For the details, please go to the "Points-System" section. 
     You can use the points to redeem items, such as food, daily supplies, etc, and we will donate those food to people in need!
     After you've donated your food, you will receive corresponding "achievement points", and you can use those points to change for small gifts!
     <br>
     Also, you will be able to see the plant photos you've uploaded, and you can make your unique photo collections for your cute baby plants!
